# Linear-Regression
Java program that models (Straight line)Linear Regression: y = b0 + b1x
Two arrays act like data points: 1st array holds data that would represent points on the X axis of a graph. 2nd array holds data that would represent points on the Y axis of a graph.
The program reads the arrays, runs each value through the Linear Regression formula to find the best fitting line, if this were to be viewed on a graph. The equation for the best fitting line is printed, for easy graphing of the line.
